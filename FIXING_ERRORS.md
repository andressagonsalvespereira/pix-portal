# Fixing Build Errors

## CheckoutPage.tsx Errors

The errors in `src/pages/CheckoutPage.tsx` are related to a missing `fonte` property. 
To fix this, update your `CheckoutPage.tsx` file to include proper type handling:

1. Import the provided type:
```tsx
import { CheckoutConfigType } from '@/types/checkoutConfig';
```

2. Update your type annotations to use this type where you're accessing config data.

## Type Issues

The errors indicate that your database types need to be updated to match what your code is expecting.
Either:

1. Update your database schema to include all fields being used in the code, or
2. Update your type definitions to match the current database schema.

## SetupTests.ts Error

The error in `src/setupTests.ts` is related to TypeScript type compatibility with the matchMedia mock.
To fix it, update the mock implementation to have the correct signature.
